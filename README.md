The purpose of this script is to automatically move data from a GenLive POS report into a formatted .xlsx report. 

# Getting Started

In this window, enter ```pip install openpyxl==2.6.2```. Congrats! You have all the dependencies to make this work. 

# To Use

To use this script, put a POS report saved in .xlsx format, the daily report you wish to output to, and the script in the **same folder**. 

Once you have that set up, run the script by double clicking it. You will be prompted with on screen instructions. Once the program finishes executing, a copy of the daily report will appear in the folder the script was placed in.
